To create a blank WaMDaM database in SQL Server, 
Open SQL Server, Click File >> New >> Query with Current Condition 
Simply copy all this [script](https://github.com/WamdamProject/WaMDaM_Information_Model/blob/master/schemas/MS_SQL_Server/WaMDaM_Nov2017_MSSQL.sql) and paste into the new window of "create query"  
Then click "execute". The script should run successfully and create the 41 empty tables of WaMDaM 

Alternativily, you could attach a [copy](schemas/MS_SQL_Server/blank_db_copy) of WaMDaM MS SQL Server database
